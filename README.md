# CSS & JavaScript-Animations:

## Description

This project is aimed to create parallax effects for images and a nice spotlight effect for the mouse. It is aimed to add flair to a slideshow of images that can be used in any application. The challenges faced in this project was finding a way to connect the JavaScript to the CSS through data that can be leveraged from the window. This was the most important part of getting the parallax of the images and the spotlight to follow the mouse.

In the future, I plan to use the skills learnt here to incorporate them into front-end projects to give them an extra pop when users visit the site.
